Some terminology:
    Registry key - an entry in the Windows configuration database. Each
        key can contain multiple values.
    Registry value - an item in the Windows configuration database.
        Values are typed and always exist inside keys; you can think of keys
        as being directories and values as being files.
    Section - represents a block of memory that is shared between two
        processes. In particular, if a section has a name, it can be
        used as a communication channel between two processes.
    Port - named objects used by Windows to implement interprocess
        communication (IPC). Various calls then let you send and receive
        messages on that port (similar to a network port)
        [Note: these are not all that well understood -- but the important
        piece is that each port typically represents a client/server
        relationship between two processes]
