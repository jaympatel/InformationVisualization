# Lab 1
-----------------------------------------------
For this assignment you have to update the page created in class so that it 
will be possible to provide a country name and return the GDP of the given 
country. Here is a screenshot of how the final solution should look like:
![alt text](img/lab1.png "Output Image")


The user should be able to type the country name in the search box and, after clicking on GO the system should show the GDP next to the search box, as shown above.

=> **SUBMIT** one single HTML file named lastname_firstname_1.html

All your code (HTML, CSS and Javascript) should be within this single file. 

The d3 library has to be imported using the following tag: 
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.6/d3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You should use the following data (feel free to copy and paste it):

```javasscript
var countries = [
    { name: "Brazil", GDP: 1000 },
    { name: "Iraq", GDP: 890 },
    { name: "US", GDP: 300 },
    { name: "India", GDP: 500 }
]
```
